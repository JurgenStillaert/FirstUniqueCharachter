Problem Statement
=================
Write a method in C# that finds the first character in a given string that does not repeat. 
If all characters in the string appear more than once, the method should return a special character, say '*'.
Your solution should be efficient and handle the case of long strings quickly.

Requirements:
==============
1. Avoid checking each character multiple times. Think about how you can solve this problem in a way that minimizes repeated work.
2. You can assume the string contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.

Method Signature
=================
public char FirstNonRepeatedCharacter(string input)

Example Cases
=============
1. Input: "swiss"
	Output: 'w'
	Explanation: 's' appears more than once, but 'w' is the first character that does not repeat.

2. Input: "aabbcc"
	Output: '*'
	Explanation: All characters in this string are repeated.

Goal
====
The goal of this exercise is to find a simple and efficient way to identify the first non-repeated character. 
Think about how you can use data structures to keep track of character counts without doing unnecessary work.
